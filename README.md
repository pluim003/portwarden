# PortWarden


This project creates encrypted backups for [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) vaults including attachments. It pulls your vault items from [Bitwarden CLI](https://github.com/bitwarden/cli) and download all the attachments associated with those items to a temporary backup folder. Then, portwarden zip that folder, encrypt it with a passphrase, and delete the temporary folder. 


It addresses this issue in the community forum https://community.bitwarden.com/t/encrypted-export/235, but hopefully Bitwarden will come up with official solutions soon.

## March 15th, 2023 Update

This is the repository to build the Docker-images for the arm64-platform, to be used f.e. on a Raspberry Pi.
For the amd64-platform please use https://github.com/Sierra1011/portwarden.

Note: at this moment I haven't thoroughly tested the working of thie repository. So far I was able to create the image (which is quite large) and start the container. Now I have to figure out how everything works.


# Disclaimer
Note that you **may lose your data** if you try the restore feature and I am not responsible. Use the free software at your own discretion.  Since we don't handle restoration conflicts,  **make sure to back up with your main account and restore to a spare/alternative account**. 


## Usage Of Portwarden CLI

Go to https://github.com/bitwarden/cli/releases to download the latest version of Bitwarden CLI and place the executable `bw`/`bw.exe` in your `PATH`. Then, go to https://github.com/pluim003/portwarden/releases/ to download the latest release of `portwarden`. Now just follow these steps :


```bash
# If you are running self hosted instance, execute `bw config server https://MYSERVER.COM`
portwarden --passphrase 1234 --filename backup.portwarden encrypt
portwarden --passphrase 1234 --filename backup.portwarden decrypt
# RESTORE IS EXPERIMENTAL!! YOU MAY LOSE YOUR DATA
# IF YOU RESTORE TO YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT
# PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING

# Please use a **spare** account for restoring backup
# Portwarden doesn't handle conflicts therefore a
# separate account is needed

# In fact we setup a check to make sure the account your
# are restoring to does not have any data in it
portwarden --passphrase 1234 --filename backup.portwarden restore
```

## Contribution & Development

Clone this repo. Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed, ports 8000, 8081, 5000 unused, [Golang](https://golang.org/) installed, [dep](https://golang.github.io/dep/) installed. In addition, create an environment varialble `Salt` of length 30 for encryption salt. Then run 

```bash
dep ensure           # Install go dependencies
docker-compose up -d # Spin up required containers

# After the services/containers are created successfully, you should see
# $ docker-compose up  -d
# WARNING: Some services (worker) use the 'deploy' key, which will be ignored. Compose does not support 'deploy' configuration - use `docker stack deploy` to deploy to a swarm.

```

Notice the `docker-compose.yaml` file defines the services running and it's mounting your current directory as volumes and map it to the container's working directory. This means you can develop/make changes in your local machine, and run it in the container. It also maps certain containers' ports into your host so that you can call the endpoints.


PRs are welcome. For ideas, you could probably add a progress bar to the CLI.
